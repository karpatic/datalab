This approach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean to... The next major issue that people encounter is that they need to collaborate with developers on other systems. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git\n","\n","### How is it done?\n","\n","> This is where Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) step in. In a DVCS (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs), clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files; rather, they fully mirror the repository, including its full history. Thus, if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.  - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4okcEHilT-C7","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Git"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3wGhm_uJT-C8","colab_type":"text"},"source":["__Git__ is an open source tool used by developers to establish version control in ther projects using commands executed from the terminal. \n","\n","__Github__ (covered in the next section) is a website/ application that allows you to upload your git repository to the web for distributed collaboration, control and storage. \n","\n","> Since its birth in 2005, Git has evolved and matured to be easy to use and yet retain these initial qualities.

This means it’s impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it. This functionality is built into Git at the lowest levels and is integral to its philosophy. You can’t lose information in transit or get file corruption without Git being able to detect it. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git\n","\n","- Git Generally Only Adds Data\n","\n","  > When you do actions in Git, nearly all of them only add data to the Git database. It is hard to get the system to do anything that is not undoable or to make it erase data in any way. As with any VCS, you can lose or mess up changes you haven’t committed yet, but after you commit a snapshot into Git, it is very difficult to lose, especially if you regularly push your database to another repository. - Chacon and Straub, Pro Git\n","\n","While there are many ways to use git, the general approach follows these three stages\n","\n","<br> <img src=\"https://charleskarpati.com/img/githubCommit.png\" alt=\"Git Stages\" title=\"Git Stages\" height=\"300\"/>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OAAsWdn9T-C-","colab_type":"text"},"source":["\n","Using Git accomplished through a variety of manners:\n","\n","- Directly through the [command line](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line)\n","- Using [Github](github.com)  or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) on the web\n","- Using Github's [Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) Application (Simplified, User friendly)\n","- Or a variety of other third party tools like the web based [Prose.io](https://prose.io/) content editor"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-3cEbB7zT-C_","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Github"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kiLyIOiFT-DA","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Wheras Git may be used stand-alone for version control purposes it is often used in tandem with Github (or Bitbucket).\n","\n","Github ( a free service) enriches existing features and adds further utility, as we will see soon.\n","\n","To truly understand what this means, lets try it out!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wr5MmJF5T-DB","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### **1: Create a Github account**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vhZj6TELT-DC","colab_type":"text"},"source":["**1a.
